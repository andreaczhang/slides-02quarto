## About this workshop

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is the new way of open source publishing, and it can do [so many things](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/):

Reports and books; presentation; websites; ... Each is a <u>project</u>.

. . .

<br>

Today we build a **quarto website**, and use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to publish it.

* What makes a quarto project?
* Build and publish on GitHub
* Adding content: navigation, code and more
* time permits: interactivity with `webr`; ...


## About this workshop

## Practice 1: Set up a version controlled quarto project

:::{.callout-note}
You need 

* Github account 
* Rstudio (latest version; at least late 2022)
* Quarto (v1.2 or 1.3)

(Follow the [step-by-step tutorial part 1](https://andreaczhang.github.io/workshop-02quarto/tutorial.html))



# A minimal Quarto Project {background-color="#562457"}



## What's in a Quarto project?

* `_quarto.yml`: meta-data (e.g. layout)
* `index.qmd`: homepage
* `styles.scss`: theme (color and fonts)

![](resources/2_index_1){.absolute .fragment top="300" right="200" width="600"}

## `_quarto.yml`

In this file, some basic information of the project is specified, such as **project type**, **layout**, **theme**.

This is where you modify how the website looks like.

```
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  page-navigation: true
  title: "Zero to Quarto Workshop"

  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home

    right: 
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com
        
format:
  html:
    # theme: zephyr
    theme: styles.scss
    toc: true
```


## `index.qmd`

Your homepage: when others click the URL you shared with them, this is where they land.

Content blocked by `---` is the `YAML` header, which appears at the top of your page. Author, date can be specified here.

```

Date: **Monday 23 October 2023, 6:30PM to 8:00PM, CEST** 
------------------
 
# Welcome!

Quarto is one of the most discussed topics in the R community for the past year. In the posit conf 2023 that just happened a few weeks ago, there were 23 (!) talks on this open-source publishing system. You can build a personal or organisation website; a course or workshop website; a blog; a scientific report; a presentation; all with the possibility to display and execute code (R, Python, Julia), and for free.
```


## `styles.scss`

This file is optional; but good to have - when you want to customize the color and fonts. 

However, if you are happy with the [quarto preset themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html), `styles.scss` is not necessary for the website to work.

```
/*-- scss:defaults --*/
$theme-black: #4c4c4c;
$theme-white: white;
$theme-grey: #FAFAFA;
$theme-beige: #FFFEF2;
$theme-purple0: #FFF0F5;
$theme-purple1: #E6E6FA;
$theme-purple2: #CBC3E3;
$theme-purple3: #88398A;
$theme-purple4: #9d709e;
$theme-purple5: #562457;


$body-bg: $theme-white;
$body-color: $theme-black; // text color
$headings-color: $theme-purple5; // applies to all 
$link-color: $theme-purple4;
```


## Practice 2: Render your quarto project


Open `index.qmd`, find the **render** button. Click. 

Do you see a HTML page in your *Viewer*?

![](resources/2_index_2){.absolute .fragment top="300" right="200" width="600"}






# Publish with GitHub Pages {background-color="#562457"}

## Practice 3: configure your quarto project

You need two more things before pushing everything to GitHub.

<br>

### Set output-dir to `docs` in `_quarto.yml`

```
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

<br>

### Create `.nojekyll` file

In terminal (or your favorite command line editor), 
```
touch .nojekyll
```

<br> 

Render one last time, now commit everything, push to remote (GitHub). 

## Practice 4: Configure GH Pages

Go to Setting > Pages > Build and deployment, choose **Deploy from a branch**. 

Under **Branch**, select `/docs`. Save. It should take less than 1 minute to complete. 

Your site should be available at `https://your_username.github.io/repo_name`. 

![](resources/3_config_ghp.png){.absolute .fragment top="350" right="80" width="700"}





# Add content to your website  {background-color="#562457"}

## Site navigation, add a new page

The location of a new page is specified in `_quarto.yml` as well. 

To add another page in parallel to `Home` (to the left), add the following lines,


```
website:
  page-navigation: true
  title: "Zero to Quarto Workshop"

  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home

      - href: your_new_page.qmd
        text: Your_new_page_name
```

Then, create a new `your_new_page.qmd` document.

You can either copy and paste `index.qmd` and modify the content; or use the button top-left of Rstudio > Add new quarto document.


## Theme

Theme is controlled in `_quarto.yml` as well.

* for quarto [preset themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html), specify the names (such as `cosmo`, `zephyr`);
* for [customized themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#custom-themes) (such as the one used in he workshop), provide a `styles.scss` file where you have different colors and fonts.

```
format:
  html:
    # theme: zephyr
    theme: styles.scss
    toc: true
```


## Practice 5: Add a new page to your website

It is always a good idea to add an `about` page to your website!

<br>

### Tasks

Try to create an `about.qmd` file, write a few lines about what kind of website you wnat to create.

<br>

Position it to the right of the home page. 

<br>

Test out a few quarto themes, and/or use different colors specified in `styles.scss` (optional).


# Add content to your website (part 2) {background-color="#562457"}



## Figures and tables

One (of a few) way to add a figure: 

```
![](path_to_figure.png) 
![caption](path_to_figure.png) {width=85% fig-align="center"}
```

<br>

One (of a few) way to add a table: 

```
| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |

: Table name
```

Read about how to work on [figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) and [tables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html).



## Code chunks

Use a code fence (3 backticks) with the language you wish to run the code.

![](resources/4_rcode.png)

## Summary 

Today we went through 4 steps:

* set a version controlled quarto project
* build the project locally, configure necessary parts (`output-dir` and `.nojekyll`)
* push to GitHub, configure GH pages setting
* add more content

### Learn more

* [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/) shows a nice and inspiring collection of the types of projects you can create. Make sure you check them out!
* Official guide on creating [website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), [book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/), [presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/) and more.



## Practice 6: Add a plot to your website

Experiment with adding content to your website: 

* reproduce the code chunk example in a quarto document; (you need `ggplot2` package to do it)
* find a figure, try to include it in your quarto document
