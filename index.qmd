## About this workshop

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is the new way of open source publishing, and it can do [so many things](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/):

Reports and books; presentation; websites; ... Each is a <u>project</u>.

. . .

Today we build a **quarto website**, and use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to deploy it.

* components of a minimal quarto project
* adding content: `about` page
* build, and deploy on GitHub
* keep adding content: images and code
* time permits: styling; interactivity with `webr`; ...
